I started this blog in the middle of a rough time. I started with what i've struggled with. My first few lines were "I have to start with Whew Boy, because this week has been a doozie!! I have struggled!!! I have struggled " I must have been interrupted because that's how far I got.  I'm glad I was interrupted. 

When I started to write, I was frustrated. Frustrated because I couldn't grasp some of the concepts.  I am use to doing SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript (to a degree). But this Ruby has been difficult.  I was frustrated that this wasn't coming easily to me. I had to remember to breathe. I had to remember what I tell my daughter, take a step back, pick up something else - look at something else and come back to this. I did that often. I made mistakes. I watched hours of boring Youtube vidoes, joined study groups, chats, read through slack conversations; anything to do to break through the wall. I'm finally getting to a point of confort... a better level of understanding.  

I am looking forward. I'm excited about getting to the point of my first project. I am nervous, but i'm an anxious to get started. I want to make sure it's appropriate. I want to make and create something that help. I want to create something useful. I want to utilize my new found knowledge to create something that can benefit my current job and situation. I want to create some automation.

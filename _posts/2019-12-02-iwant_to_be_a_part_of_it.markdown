My Ode to Sinatra... The excitement and nervousness of starting a new project is starting to set in.  This time around, I feel a bit more prepared as far as expectations of the outcome.  I have set goals for myself to attend more study sessions and lessons. Also to make sure I do some code pairing so that I'm more focused and I have a better technical debt.  I felt like some areas I didn't fully grasp until  I worked with other people. 

I feel like that was due to different perspectives which I appreciate.  In working with the Education Coach and with the Career Coach, I was able to identify some strengths of mine in being able to articulate my knowledge on various subjects. To be honest, this was a worry of mine simply because I know that I get a bit tongue tied sometimes.  I also identified weaknesses of mine, hence the goals.  I also set a goal for myself to have time to process the information that I'm learning and have more practical examples.  I found that working on the project with content that I was able to create helped my understanding of the material more.  

Start Spreading The News.... Sinatra, I'm On My Way...

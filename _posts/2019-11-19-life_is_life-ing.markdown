I try to come up with these witty titles but once I actually see them, they're super cheesy. Story of my life. The name of this blog came from I've had soo much stuff going on, I almost forgot this was due -- Thankfully my calendar reminded me. I knew I had a lot to unpack from the project and I wanted to share. 

So, this is the post CLI Gem Project Blog. As expected, I struggled with the project  - not due to lack of effort, but due to my inherent need to be overly complicated.  This project has been a great task for me. It has challenged me to think outside of the box, it's challenged me to dig deeper and go beyond the scope of what we've covered and it's challenged me to keep going.  I really have enjoyed getting feedback and doing the "technical interview" style reviews. It has forced me to become comfortable in my speaking. I know I tend to get clammy and nervous when i'm trying to speak. 

There were a number of refactoring items that allowed me to explore deeper into the lessons. I think that didn't have a good understanding of what was expected prior to starting this project. What would be considered too little or what would be considered too much! 

Moving forward, we're going into SQL ((which i LOVEEEEE)) so I'm super excited about those lessons.

Hello all. Checking in, while i'm finishing up the touches to my Rails App.  This app was inspired by my brother.  He and I had a conversation back in January about how his fire department needed and thus HazardPlan was born.  I'm making it as a general scheduling application, but I look forward to building this further.  

This has been a really cool experience for me. During my Sinatra evaluation, my evaluator made a comment that has resounated with me, which was I may be more frontend web dev than backend.  That has definately shown through this project, as I've gotten creative with the gems i've been using and how I want the app to look and feel.  I feel like THAT has been my focus. I knew I wanted to encorporate a calendar so I searched Ruby Toolbox https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/ to find the perfect gem to accomplish what I was looking for. I ended up using the simple_calendar gem https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar.  I also, wanted to utilize a comments feature where the users/admin could communicate with one another and I found the trix gem https://github.com/basecamp/trix which was created by the good folks at Basecamp.  I'm big on visuals so, I was able to play around with images.  I found a really cool open source image site that I was able to incorporate some of my images from.  

I tried to do something different this time around and code as I go through the lessons, before I learned about the Scaffolding.  I feel like the items stuck with me a bit better this time around.  I've also been watching some things on Udemy and various bloggers on YouTube to supplement the lessons.  I think that helped me have a bit more flexibility to play with the look and feel of each page.  I hope everyone enjoys it.

This is the first project. I'm super excited and nervous all at once. Late last week, I got to do sit down with my adviser and really dive into the expectations of this project. I was given the impression that this would have more than just a pass/fail affect and more of a long-term confidence builder. I was given the impression this would help with technical interviews, which it's easy to prove you can/can't code, but it's a different ball game when you're having to not only sell yourself, but sell your ability to perform the job.  I am nervous/excited about having to get creative in what type of project I'd like to create.  I want to be creative but I also want it to be simple and more importantly practical.  

I'm currently in the process of moving and getting things in order to do so, I came up with the idea of creating a project that would help me get organized. That would help me save money, and that would help me get a bang for my buck.  It's always important to be useful with your creativity.  I'm also wanting to make sure that I don't over complicate things and cause myself more harm than help. I want to create a clear and concise code that executes without an issue. My hope is someone finds this useful :) 

Here I Go!

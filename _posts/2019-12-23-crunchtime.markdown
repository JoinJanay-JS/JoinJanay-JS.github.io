Hi Everyone, it's obviously crunch time.  It's the time of year where we're moving and shaking... Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year... Allowing ourselves to be wrapped up with the hustle and bustle of all the goings on in the world. I've been planning and creating a skelton for my Sinatra project. After the CLI project, I decided to make my projects meaningful for me and helpful to someone else.  I've had a few ideas.... a Tutoring App... ((already done)), a customizable ABCs teaching app... these are relevant to me, as I have two reluctant learners in the house, and to some degree, I, myself have been reluctant to learn.  
 
 
 I have a list of items that I want to create around, I am just having a hard time settling on a topic.  I have been googling the types of applications/web apps that are based off of sinatra, just trying to get an idea of what types of things I can build.

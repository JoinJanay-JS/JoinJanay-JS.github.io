So, it's been a while since I've made a blog post. I had to get myself together and refocus. I STRUGGLED with my last project, not because of lack of effort, but because of lack of focus.  I had to go back and relearn concepts.  But I did it! I finished it, I accomplished another project goal.  Learning Sinatra has been really fun, but it's also been challenging.  I have to remember to def certain items on each controller. I have to remember certain punctuation and make sure i'm not being sloppy with my codes or even too fast which leads to issues. Most importantly, I have to be clear in what it is i'm trying to accomplish.  I notice going through this process, I would start one idea and not fully complete it before I began another.  

I continue to struggle with making time, but i'm getting better as this is a goal I would like to accomplish.  

Ironically though, this app became super necessary (or at least the concept) due to Covid19. I am now forced to lesson plan for my 4 year old (which i totally love, as I was a teacher in a past life).  I want to continue to grow this app to help organize lesson plans for working mommies who have kids who aren't interested in certain subjects.

Hey Everyone! Welcome. I have been super excited about this project.  As stated in my last blog, I feel like this project can grow into something special. I created this project with my 4 year old in mind.  She gets super bugged out when has to do ANYTHING relating to the alphabet (with the exception of singing the alphabet song).  She's not been as receiptive of learning her letters or numbers frankly.  I noticed that she was more receptive when we did real life things - for example, she plays basketball - she get excited about the number on the back of her jersey and she's now learned numbers based on the number of her teammates jerseys. Ah-HA!!! My lightbulb moment. 

So I decided to get creative in my approach, then that presented another issue -- where are my apps/sites like ABC Mouse where they provide physical activities. I found a few, and was inspired to create another.  I feel like I have to sneakily teach her things - hence the name SneakyTeacher :) 

So, I started doing some framework of my Sinatra app based on the Corneal gem.  I started using the sandbox from the learn IDE - and ran into an unfamiliar issue BigDecimal error - I still don't really know how/why that happened but apparently I can workaround it.  So far haven't ran into any more issues... My plan is to blog as I work through the project :) 

So, an update... I've added a few models and I keep adding new features - which i'm trying to slow down - I'm working on a tags/category feature that will link and join things.  I'm super excited about that. 

I tried to update the astetic of my application and broke it! :( I have to fix it and update my gemfile - I tried to add a bootstrap website and modify the page. 


I broke my visual studio again!! :( I actually didn't and i'm totally being dramatic. I deleted my ssh file - so I couldn't push my project to github.  But my new cohort lead helped me get that fixed.  

I want to add a feature of import/upload and parsing a document and integrating it in my sqlite database.  That's more of a wishlist item.  

I also had to clean up a lot of my code I had a TON of small issues (misspelled words, missing commas, etc) that caused issues with my project.  I want to make sure this is perfect, as this seems like a passion project.  :) 

--I scrapped the tags/categories for right now 
i have also tabled a part of my activities for right now, so that I have the simpliest form of the requirements to pass the project.  But I feel like I have what i need as a foundation for something great and big.

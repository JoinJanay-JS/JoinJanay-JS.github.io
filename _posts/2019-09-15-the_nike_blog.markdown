Greetings and hello... 

Here we are experiencing this journey together, congratulations for starting... I don't know if you're like me and this journey took years (literally YEARS) in the making, I don't know if you're like me and have doubted your ability to accomplish this, I don't know if you're like me and life has just life'd and prevented you from being great... but nonetheless we've made it... 
I've always known that I like being in tech, I have worked in helpdesk, software support and system admininistration. I know I want something different... I want the freedom of knowing that I can decide to stop working for corporate america and start something that can building into my own company, which can be left to my children or they can grow it if they so chose to. I love the idea of being able to use my creativity to make a difference in the world about something i'm passionate about... 
I was tired, I was tired of being undervalued in my job, I was tired of being unappreciated, but most of all I was tired of feeling uninspired... 
So, I had to just do it...

Happy New Year!! These last few weeks have sparked an energy inside of me that has me wanting to complete and finsh things i've started.  I'm in a space of cleaning house.  I'm SUPER SUPER excited about my Sinatra project and how it's coming along.  I am so excited about this project, that I feel that this can grow into a bigger. 

I've already started the framework for my project. My plan is to get about 2 hours of coding each night between work and bed.  I am super excited (and nervous) about the technical interview portion of the project.  I want to be sure i'm better than before. I want to feel more secure in the questions I am answering.  I felt before, I was a bit shaky, but I feel this time around I can be more prepared.  I've also started to look at some of the requirement for jobs in the software development world and trying to gauge the technical debt that I would need.
